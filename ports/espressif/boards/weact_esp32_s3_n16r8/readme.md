Community (ie: im not affiliated with them) port for WeAct's [ESP32-S3-N16R8](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005005592730189.html)

VID/PID randomly filled

Note: If my understanding of the datasheet is correct, the N/R naming refers to **embedded** flash/psram, so this board should really be named "ESP32-S3-R8"
